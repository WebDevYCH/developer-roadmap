# Threads and Concurrency

A thread is an execution context in which the instructions to the CPU can be scheduled and executed independently of the parent process. Concurrency is the concept of multiple threads in a shared memory space being computed simultaneously (or intermittently executed in succession to provide that illusion). Concurrency allows multiple processes to execute at once and can apply to programming languages as well as operating systems.
