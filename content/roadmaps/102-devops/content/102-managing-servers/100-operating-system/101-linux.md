# Linux
Linux is the operating system that powers most of the web today.  User interfaces exist for Linux as a desktop operating system, but Linux's most common role is as a server, where the operating system is only interacted with via the [Command Line Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface). Linux is an open source project, of which there are many "distributions" or "distros".  The distro you choose to learn is not of particular importance, just know that some problems are handled differently on different distributions.  This means there may not be 1:1 compatibility of a tutorial for Ubuntu to another distro.
