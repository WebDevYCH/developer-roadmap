# Accessibility
The Web is an increasingly important resource in many aspects of life: education, employment, government, commerce, health care, recreation, and more. It is essential that the Web be accessible in order to provide equal access and equal opportunity to people with diverse abilities. Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them.
