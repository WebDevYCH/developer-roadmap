The intent of this guide is to give you an idea about the Python ecosystem and to help guide your learning if you are confused. We have another roadmap on the [Backend Development](/backend) that focuses on the backend development if you are interested in that.

Also, please note that the list below is exhaustive, and the items are listed in no particular order. You don't need to learn everything listed in the picture, however knowing what you don't know is as important as knowing things.
