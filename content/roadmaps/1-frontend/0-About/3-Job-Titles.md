## Common Job Titles
If you know frontend development, there are jobs with different titles that you can apply to. Here is the list of different job titles with almost same responsibilities

* Frontend Developer / Engineer
* JavaScript Developer
* JavaScript Engineer
* HTML / CSS Developer
* UI Developer
* Web Developer
* FullStack Developer

Having Web Developer or FullStack developer in the title would normally mean that you need to have some backend skills as well. Most of the small or service based companies require you to have backend and some UI designing skills as well so it is better to look at the job description also once you have shortlisted the jobs to apply to.
