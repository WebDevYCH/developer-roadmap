## Become a Frontend Developer
Before I go ahead and list down the resources, please know that the roadmap and the list below is exhaustive and you don't need to know it all from the get go. For frontend development, all you need to get started with is learn some basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript and start working on projects; everything else you will learn along the way. 

## Internet and how it works?

Get the basic understanding of internet, browsers, networks and other relevant knowledge.

## Learn HTML
HTML provides the skeleton of a webpage. Learn the basics of HTML; learn the basic tags, learn how to write semantic HTML, understand basic SEO, learn how to divide your pages into sections that will help you style them. 

Please know that I have put multiple links for each resource. While you may pick something new while going through each, you don't need to go through all of them - if you feel like you have understood the concepts and are just repeating what you learnt, you may skip the resource and move to exercises section.
