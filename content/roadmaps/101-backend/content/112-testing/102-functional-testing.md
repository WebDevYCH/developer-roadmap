# Functional Testing

Functional testing is where software is tested to ensure functional requirements are met. Usually, it is a form of black box testing in which the tester has no understanding of the source code; testing is performed by providing input and comparing expected/actual output.
It contrasts with non-functional testing, which includes performance, load, scalability, and penetration testing.
