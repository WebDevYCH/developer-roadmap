# CAP theorem

CAP Theorem is a Theoretical Computer Science concept stating that in any distributed system there are Three factors.

<b>C</b>onsistency </br>
<b>A</b>vailability </br>
<b>P</b>artition Tolerance

In any distributed system, there will be cases where the network goes down. This means you have to choose between designing a system for <b>C</b>onsistency (Data will be the same across all instances, meaning the application is unavailable) or <b>A</b>vailability (The Data will not be the same across all instances but the application will be available)
